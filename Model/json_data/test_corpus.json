The military now tests recruits\nfor AIDS before vaccinating them.\n    The findings, reported in The New England Journal of\nMedicine, are significant because scientists have begun working\non an AIDS vaccine that relies on the smallpox vaccine.\n     \"Our case report raises provocative questions concerning\nthe ultimate safety of such vaccines,\" said the group led by\nDr. Robert Redfield.\n     The report also throws into question the belief held by\nsome scientists that the smallpox vaccine, which exposes people\nto a milder, protective form of the disease known as cowpox,\ncould be further modified to protect people against a host of\nother diseases.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

          "description": "U.S. economic data this week could be\nthe key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break\nout of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said.\n    Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail\nsales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy\ngains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be\npositive for the market, the analysts said.\n    \"You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds\nright now,\" said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig\nSloane.\n    Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which\ntraders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a\nrise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest\nto break below chart support in the June contract failed to\nmaterialize, participants who had sold bond futures early\nquickly covered short positions, they said.\n    \"Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in\nas expected it won't be that bad for the market,\" Sloane said.\n    Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector\nof retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct.\n    Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure\nbelow market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and\nshe put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up\n0.8 to 1.2 pct.\n    Industrial production and the producer price index Friday\nboth are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she\nadded.\n    Retail sales \"will tell us whether or not we will be able\nto fill the gap,\" Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June\nbonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds\nclosed at 100-4/32 today.\n    Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the\nfederal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said\nCarroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer.\n    \"A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the\nmarket from breaking out of the trading range the last time the\nmarket approached the top of the range,\" Singer said.\n    In order for bonds to break above the top of the range,\nwhich is just below 102 in the June contract, \"the crude oil\nrally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,\"\nSinger said. \"Fed funds are already easing back down toward the\nsix pct level.\"\n    The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to\nManufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally\nmay be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said.\n    Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to\nease to 99-6/32 and find support.\n    \"I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet.\nThe jury is still out this week,\" Rozich said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",
