          "description": "Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like\nbeacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.\n    One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,\nwas all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.\n    The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and\nconcrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60\nmetres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.\nDestroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.\n    The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section\nof the structure remained.\n    U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an\nAmerican helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.\nforces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had\nbeen caught laying mines.\n    But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense\nofficials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm\nmissiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday\nand the Sea Isle City on Friday.\n    Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a\nkey backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.\n    Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East\nnow with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti\ntankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.\n    But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level\nof violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result\nof U.S. intervention and Iran's response.\n    The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a\nU.S. \"tit-for-tat\" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said\nHarlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.\n    He said with this appraoch America would suffer \"the death\nof one thousand cuts.\"\n    But for the United States to grab the initiative\nmilitarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's\nharbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its\nshipping must pass, Schuler said.\n    He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing\nIran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,\nTehran could not continue the war with Iraq.\n    Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic\ninitiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an\narms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.\n    He said the United States should also threaten to mine and\nblockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to\nacknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a\nsettlement.\n    Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by\ninvading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the\noutbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style\ninfantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.\n    Each side has attacked the others' shipping.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It's up to Tehran to\nrespond one way or the other,\" a diplomat said.\n    President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American\ncountermeasures if the military escalation continued.\n    Western diplomats and military sources in the area said\nshelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act\nthe United States could have taken once it had decided to\nretaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans\nand Kuwaitis on Iran.\n    \"It's interesting that they chose something in international\nwaters because it doesn't implicate any other nation,\" one\ndiplomat said. \"This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf\nArab states, particularly Kuwait.\"\n    Commented another diplomat: \"Kuwait must be happy that the\nU.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked\non its doorstep.\"\n    One source said of the attack on the oil platform: \"They\nmanaged to warn off the crew and hit something that was the\nleast nuisance to everybody.\"\n    A diplomat commented: \"They were very clever in the place\nthey chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated\nanything because it wasn't working in the first place.\"\n    A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:\n\"This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up\n... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans).\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Eugene Carroll\nof Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)\nthink tank.\n    Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for\nWashington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to\nthe war between Iran and Iraq.\n    They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its\n30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began\nescorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal \nwould give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which\nPresident Reagan could never accept.\n    U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon\nnews conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel\nfired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam\noil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf\ntime (0700 EDT) on Monday.\n    Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military\nbase by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian\nSilkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea\nIsle City on Friday.\n    Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and\nallowed to escape.\n    \"We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will\nbe prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran\nwith stronger countermeasures,\" Weinberger said.\n    \"We consider this matter closed,\" he said.\n    Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives\nagreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not\nescalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was\nwhether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken\nthis view after earlier clashes.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The NSPA charged that Argentina's differential\nexport taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in\ncompetition with the U.S.\n    \"Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict\n(Argentine) access to our market,\" said one U.S. source.\n   \n    The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after\nTrade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to\nend the differential.\n    But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88\nyear in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.\n    Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture\nminister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille\non September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not\nnarrow the differential further for 1987/88.\n    As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is considering\nrestrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef\nand finished leather, the U.S. sources said.\n    A decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the Reagan\nadministration soon, they said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The Bank plans to use the\nfunds gradually over the next three or four years, he said.\n    To facilitate lending increases the Bank tripled paid-in\ncapital to about 18 billion dlrs from six billion in June.\n    German bankers at the presentation criticized the Bank for\nits overly conservative lending, adding the Bank would do\nbetter to invest more capital in loans. Total net equity\ncapital, consisting of subscribed capital and reserves, rose to\n1,282 pct of its funded debt in 1986 from 552 pct in 1985, the\nBank's statistics showed.\n    Other Bank figures from 1986 showed the Interamerican\nDevelopment Bank's net equity totaled 302 pct of funded debt,\nand the Asian Development Bank's 295 pct.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Reuter and\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September\nproduction at 18.5 mln bpd.\n    The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of\na Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea\nIsle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,\nin Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag\ncommercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.\n    The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the\narea on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.\n    Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on\nMonday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.\nAttack, analysts said.\n    They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which\naround eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in\nthe interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.\n    Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in\nthe number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf\nhostilities, analysts said.\n    But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian\nmissile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.\n    Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,\nsaid he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.\n    \"The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond\nto Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any\nfurther action will be met with a like-for-like response.\nToday's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,\" Pyne said.\n    Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was \"a\nresponsible retaliation,\" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to\nIran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran\nchose to raise the level of conflict.\n    Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.\n    He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as\nArab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests\nthe U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a\nresult of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian\nretaliation.\n    The initial upward market move this morning reflected a\nstrong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which\nwas thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile\nlaunchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.\n    The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy\nattack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary\nCaspar Weinburger.\n    Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the\nGulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less\nserious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,\nanalysts and traders said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Although the rise shocked the bank into\nmore flexibility, the problem remained.\n    The reform proposal, which Hauri said had been planned for\nyears, was given to banks and other interested parties for\ncomment on September 30.\n    They have until the end of this month to suggest\nalterations. Subject to such changes, and to the government\ngo-ahead, it will come into force on January 1, Hauri said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

          "description": "The Supreme Court let stand a ruling\nthat Northrop Corp <NOC> must pay 31 mln dlrs to a company\ncontrolled by Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi.\n    The court denied a Northrop appeal challenging a U.S.\narbitration tribunal's ruling that it pay 31 mln dlrs in\ncommissions and interest stemming from arms contracts it won\nfrom Saudi Arabia in the early 1970s.\n    Northrop, seeking to sell F-5 fighter aircraft and\nsupporting services to Saudi Arabia, hired Khashoggi's firm in\n1970 as its marketing representative.\n    Northrop paid more than 17 mln dlrs in commissions to\nKhashoggi's firm, Triad International Marketing, from 1971 to\n1975. U.S. Defense Department records showed that Northrops'\nsales to Saudi Arabia during this period totaled 4.2 billion\ndlrs.\n    The legal battle dates back to 1979, when Khashoggi began\narbitration proceedings seeking payment of more than 150 mln\ndlrs in commissions due under his agreement with Northrop.\n    A federal judge in 1984 threw out the arbitration panel's\naward of 31 mln dlrs to Khashoggi's firm, but a U.S. Court of\nAppeals reinstated it last March.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

          "description": "The Louvre accord on currency stability,\nwhich has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since\nlast February, appeared in serious danger today as a\ntransatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to\nthe boil, foreign exchange dealers said.\n    But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and\nbond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial\ncountries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem\nbetween the United States and West Germany and insisted that\nthe currency pact was still alive.\n    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market\nfears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term\ninterest rates. \"That's not in keeping with the spirit of what\nwe agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,\"\nBaker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was\nreferring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group\nof Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the\npact.\n    Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both\nhave large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic\ngrowth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.\nAgreed to stop talking the dollar down.\n    However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre\nagreement was still operative, the West German interest rate\nmove would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.\n    \"The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that\nhe's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets\nare off in terms of currency cooperation,\" Chris Johns, currency\nanalyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.\n    But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine\nview, telling Reuters that \"the exchange market is apparently\nreacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker\ncomment will regret it later on.\"\n    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the\nLouvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to\nrespond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for \"a faithful\nand firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the\nLouvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit.\"\n    Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British\nTreasury commented on the row.\n    But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite\nU.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, \"this does\nnot represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the\nLouvre Accord.\"\n    In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive\nof West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that\nfollowing recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.\nWas still committed to the accord.\n    In a move which the market interpreted as a possible\ngesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term\nliquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on\nMonday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected\nmedium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also\nstepped into the French money market to hold down rates,\ninjecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose\nclose to eight pct.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

          "description": "British Sugar Plc was forced to shut its\nIpswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute\nshortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a\nReuter inquiry\n    Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination\nof very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the\nfactory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week's\nhurricane which blocked roads.\n    The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are\ncleared and supplies of beet build up again.\n    This is the first time in many years that a factory has\nbeen closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.\n    Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,\nbut harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.\n    Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British\nSugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year\nout of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.\n    Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting\nproblems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining\nits estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2\nmln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the\nspokesman said.\n    British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.\n    The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,\nis expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories\nnormally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the\ncampaign.\n    As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been\nharvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13\npct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather has\nseverely restricted beet lifting.\n    Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yet\navailable.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

          "description": "The recent sharp rise in U.S. interest\nrates sparked turmoil in the fixed-income markets, but\nunderwriters said they doubt company treasurers will rush to\nborrow before rates increase further.\n    \"Corporate treasurers will continue to issue new debt when\nthey believe they are borrowing at an attractive rate,\" said an\nunderwriter with a major Wall Street house.\n    Said another, \"We will not see a flood of new offerings.\nTreasurers are reassessing the market. We will not see new\nissuance dry up either.\"\n    Still, the pace of corporate borrowing in the public\nfinance market has slowed, according to a Reuter tabulation.\n    Last week, which was shortened by the Columbus Day holiday,\nsaw issuance of 1.3 billion dlrs of new debt. That was down\nfrom the prior week's tally of slightly more than two billion\ndlrs of new debt.\n    In contrast, a year ago it was not unusual to see those\namounts of new offerings in a single day as companies took\nadvantage of the then decline in interest rates to refinance\nold, higher-cost debt or to expand operations via financings at\nlow, attractive rates, underwriters noted.\n    \"Companies will conduct financings that they believe are\nessential,\" said an underwriter with a medium-sized Wall Street\nfirm. \"But we will not see much more than that until the market\nstabilizes.\"\n    In the meantime, treasurers will probably prefer shorter\nterm issues, analysts said. For instance, of last week's nine\nissues, only one had a maturity of more than 10 years.\n    The other offerings had maturities of two to seven years,\nwith most clustered in the two to three year area, according to\na Reuter tabulation. That is because single-digit interest\nrates were had last week only among two-year securities.\n    \"If people think that interest rates will continue to head\nhigher, then we could see treasurers rushing to market,\" said a\ntrader with a medium-sized securities house.\n    \"But if people think last week's sharp interest rate rise\nis a fluke, treasurers will sit back and wait for rates to\ndecline before issuing new debt, hoping of course that they are\nnot missing the boat by doing so,\" she added.\n    Another impediment to new issuance is the lukewarm\nreception to new issues by institutional and retail investors\nin recent weeks, traders pointed out. Many investors refrained\nfrom buying because they believed rate would rise further.\n    \"We saw a lot of buying interest last week, but people are\nnot yet willing to pull the trigger,\" a broker said. \"They\nwould rather wait and see if the recent rate increase can be\nsustained.\"\n    Conflicting forecasts on the likely direction of interest\nrates did not help, analysts said. For instance, Henry Kaufman,\nchief economist with Salomon Brothers Inc, said in his weekly\n\"Comments on Credit\" that the yields of U.S. Treasury bonds\nwould probably rise further because the marketplace expects\ninflation to rise and the dollar to continue to decline.\n    In contrast, Standard and Poor's Corp said on Friday that\nprices of debt securities in the fixed-income markets would\nrecover. The rating agency said neither the economy nor the\ndollar justify current high yields.\n    Meanwhile, the Chicago Board of Trade is slated to hold a\npress briefing on Tuesday in New York about its plans to list a\nfutures contract based on a corporate bond index.\n    That follows last week's announcement by Commodity Exchange\nInc, Comex, that it plans to list on October 29 a new futures\ncontract based on the investment-grade corporate bond index of\nMoody's Investors Service Inc.\n Reuter\n\u0003",
          "snippet": "The recent sharp rise in U.S. interest\nrates sparked turmoil in the fixed-income markets, but\nunderwriters said they doubt company treasurers will rush to\nborrow before rates increase further.",

          "description": "The Soviet Union outlined its economic\ntargets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improve\nstandards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.\n    Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet\nindustrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a\nplanned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.\n    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent\nto gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a\nplanned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the\noutput of a country's goods and services.\n    He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of\ngrain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow\nproduced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.\n    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described\nmachine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is\nessential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on\nworld markets.\n    \"Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the\nmachine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a\nconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires,\" said\nTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.\n    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes\nmachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,\nincreased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987\ncompared with the same period last year.\n    However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned\nfor the industry for the whole of 1988.\n    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent\nmeeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to\na large extent on conserving resources better. \"Large-scale\nmeasures are planned to save resources,\" he said.\n    Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that\ndefense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same\nfigure as was announced last year.\n    Western governments view official Soviet estimates for\ndefense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure\nis hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are\nintertwined with the civilian economy.\n    Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending\nnext year on medical services, education, pensions and social\ninsurance schemes.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

          "description": "Today's sharp sell-off of Swiss stocks and\nmatching falls around Europe may have been overdone, but the\nmood on financial markets is precarious, Swiss securities\nanalysts and economists said.\n    Panic selling took Swiss shares down six pct at the opening\non enormous volume, triggered by the slide on Wall Street and\nthe threat of renewed currency instability.\n    \"I have never experienced anything like this, and I've been\nin the business for 20 years,\" said Bernhard Wyttenbach, head of\nEuropean research at Union Bank of Switzerland.\n    The analysts blamed the sell-off in Europe on U.S. Monetary\nauthorities. This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker\npublicly voiced his displeasure with West German monetary\npolicy. He said the eight-month-old Louvre accord to stabilise\ncurrencies was still working, but added: \"On the other hand, we\nwill not sit back and watch surplus countries jack up interest\nrates and squeeze growth on the expectation that the United\nStates will raise rates.\"\n    Hans Peter Ast of Societe Generale Alsacienne (Sogenal) in\nZurich said: \"The situation is very dangerous. Statements by the\nU.S. Authorities have fuelled anxiety about interest rates.\"\n    Herbert Fritschi, director of Zurich Cantonal Bank's\nfinancial research department, called the sell-off \"overdone,\"\nbut warned that the situation could worsen unless central banks\nloosen their monetary policy.\n    \"I think the trend toward higher interest rates is over,\" he\nsaid. \"The Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have to step in\nwith an easy money policy, or else there is going to be an\neconomic catastrophe. They have to act quickly.\"\n    Wyttenbach said the \"Black Monday\" sell-off was clearly\nexaggerated, with Swiss Reinsurance Co participation\ncertificates falling 20 pct in value at one point.\n    But Wyttenbach said he did not believe that a correction\nwould come soon. First, the bad news will reach small investors\nonly in time for tomorrow's market, when there could be\nanother, smaller selling wave.\n    \"As soon as the dollar stabilises -- and that's the key --\nthen we'll get a strong movement upward,\" Wyttenbach said. But\nthat may not come soon.\n    \"People are simply worried that in America, where the market\nhas now fallen by 18 pct since August, the bull market is over,\"\nhe said. \"People are afraid that we'll have a recession in 1988.\"\n    Baker was wrong to blame the West Germans for the current\nproblems and the weak dollar, Wyttenbach said. \"We do not have a\nmark problem, we have a dollar problem,\" he added, but said the\nbiggest culprit was the new chairman of the U.S. Federal\nReserve Board, Alan Greenspan.\n    Wyttenbach recalled that Greenspan had suggested that the\ndollar might be too high in the medium term and that interest\nrates might have to rise. \"As a central banker he shouldn't do\nthat,\" Wyttenbach said. \"There is a danger that we will fall back\ninto the 1970s,\" he said. \"We have a real crisis of confidence in\nGreenspan. I would much rather have a Volcker.\"\n    Paul Volcker retired as Fed chairman on August 11.\n    Cantonal Bank's Fritschi said: \"I'm relatively optimistic\nbecause the situation looks too bad. The Fed certainly has to\nintervene.\"\n    He said he did not expect the Swiss National Bank to take\nany significant steps, adding that the focus of attention\nremains on the United States.\n    \"The panic started in New York, it has to end there.\"\n    The Cantonal Bank sent an advisory to customers suggesting\nthey not sell into a panicked market, but wait a while before\ndeciding what to do.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The economy is not receiving a\nconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires,\" said\nTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee Gosplan.\n    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes\nmachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,\nincreased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of this\nyear against the same period of 1986. This is well below the\n7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988.\n    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo concluded at a recent\nmeeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to\na large extent on conserving resources better. \"Large-scale\nmeasures are planned to save resources,\" he said.\n    Finance Minister Boris Gustev told the Supreme Soviet\ndefence spending in 1988 would total 20.2 billion roubles, the\nsame as announced last year.\n    Talyzin said the Kremlin also had decided to increase\nspending next year on medical services, education, pensions and\nsocial insurance schemes\n    He said state expenditures in these fields would reach 171\nbillion roubles in 1988, or 3.5 billion roubles more than had\noriginally been envisaged in the 1986-1990 Five-Year Plan.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

          "description": "South Korea's national news agency, Yonhap,\nsaid this year's current account surplus will near 10 billion\ndlrs amid signs of continuing high world demand for the\ncountry's cheap cars and electronic goods.\n    Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny the\nYonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its own\nfigures later in the week.\n    Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the current\naccount, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled\n7.03 billion dlrs.\n    This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for the\nwhole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks with\nthe International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapid\nrevaluation of the won against the dollar.\n    The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs,\nup from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier.\n    \"Exports in October could be relatively modest due to many\npublic holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus will\nbe well over nine billion dollars, close to ten,\" Yonhap said.\n    The sharp rise in the September surplus came from a\nresumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previous\nmonth.\n    More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers,\nelectronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrest\nbetween July and September.\n    The South Korean government originally targeted a five\nbillion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raise\nthis to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half export\nboom.\n    If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplus\nseemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the United\nStates which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit with\nSeoul last year, government economists said.\n    The U.S. Government, trying to stem protectionist pressure\nat home, has called on South Korea to open more markets to\nAmerican goods and revalue the won faster.\n    The won was fixed at 804.90 against the dollar on Monday,\nrepresenting a 7.01 pct gain so far this year.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

          "description": "Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the key\nsupplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least\nthe next five years, oil industry sources said.\n    Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane and\nbutane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on Saudi\nArabian LPG, the sources said.\n    They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associate\nof crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. \"Saudi\nis a reliable supplier in that sense,\" said one trader.\n    Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia.\n    No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an\nLPG supply source to Japan, the sources said.\n    \"Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,\nwhich has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf\ncould easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities\nin that area,\" said another trader.\n    Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20\npct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at\nAl-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back to\ncontractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from\nother ports.\n    Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude\nrather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPG\nsupply disruptions, traders said.\n    They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was\nunlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.\n    Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly\nrise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a\nmoderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.\n    Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift\nslightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports from\nIndonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.\n    The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in\nlarge scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian\nLPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the\nyear ended March 1987, the sources said.\n    But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down\nterm purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on\nthe spot market, they said.\n    Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which\n5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under term\ncontracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct of\nJapan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.\n    Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made\nsome concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the\nrecent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the\nJapanese will accept the offer, the sources said.\n    The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been\nunsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to\nreplace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.\n    Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by\nPetromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87\npct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)\nof Arabian Light.\n    Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings\nshould the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian\nLight's GSP.\n    Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the\n95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,\nthe trade sources said.\n    Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying\nup to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to\nseller-buyer agreement.\n    Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut\nsupplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.\n    \"If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable\nbasis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct,\" said\nan official at a major importer. \"Freight costs are higher for\ncargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a\nlonger haul and war risk insurance payments.\"\n    Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to\nfinalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on\ncontractual period and volume, which could be very similar to\ncurrent levels, the sources said. \"When we talk business, we\nwould seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of\nhigh dependence on a single supplier,\" said one.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The same applied to expected parent company losses,\nhe added.\n    Dassler said Puma had taken measures to improve future\nperformance.\n    Dassler said the measures included changing Puma's  \nproduct range, closing down some unprofitable factories in West\nGermany and France and introducing general cost-cutting.\n    He said Puma hoped to break even in 1988 in the U.S., Its\nmost important export market.\n    Dassler said a personal payment he would make to\nshareholders instead of a 1986 dividend was a goodwill gesture\nwhich would not be repeated.\n    Dassler said the payment to holders of Puma's 280,000\nnon-voting preference shares would amount to about 1.2 mln\nmarks, or 4.50 marks per share.\n    Armin Dassler and his brother Gerd hold all of Puma's\n720,000 ordinary voting shares.

          "description": "Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's\ncentral bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are\nnormally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the\ncentral bank's independence.\n    But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,\npresident of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a\ncontroversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of\nthe country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.\n    Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last\nThursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and\ninterest rates\n    Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's\ncriticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place\nfor foreign investors.\n    \"The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and\nFinance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign\ninvestors,\" said one economist for a London broker, who asked\nnot to be identified.\n    Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial\npolicy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to\nsteer the economy through a particularly difficult time.\n    \"There are plenty of objective pressures which will result\nin things getting back to normal again after a period of ill\nfeeling,\" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.\n    News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct\nwithholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in\na market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and\nabroad.\n    Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the\nfinance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the\nBundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting\ndetails to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.\n    Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under\nextraordinary pressures lately.\n    Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his\ndeputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight\ninflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had\npursued so far this year to promote currency stability.\n    In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like\nSchlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been\nwarning in speech after speech that excessive money supply\ngrowth would eventually lead to rising prices.\n    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank\ncouncil, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his\nviews, bankers said.\n    \"Poehl is in a minority in his own house,\" said Commerzbank's\nPfister.\n    \"Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not\nentirely his own,\" said another economist.\n    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,\nthey will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark\nand hurting West German exporters.\n    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the\nBundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.\n    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James\nBaker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.\n    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986\nwar of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.\nOfficials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to\nstimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.\n    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round\nof tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.\n    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for\nStoltenberg than he had bargained for.\n    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted\nmost popular government politician last year, had to face\nresistance from local barons in the government coalition\nparties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.\n    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising\n4.3 billion marks.\n    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will\npush up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the\ngovernment could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.\n    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row\nwhich has turned into the country's worst political scandal.\n    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last\nmonth early to sort out a row in the northern state of\nSchleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.\n    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after\nallegations of a \"dirty tricks\" election campaign led to heavy\nlosses for the CDU in state elections.\n    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last\nweekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.\n    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more\nremarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and\nwas appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.\n    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this\nyear, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government\ngave Poehl another eight-year term.\n    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he\nhoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.\n    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was\nnot only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the\nBundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he\nnoted.\n    A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in\nmonetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would\nnever attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar\nagainst the mark or the yen.\n    The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between\n140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.\n    The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and\n141.35 yen.\n    \"Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher\ninterest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this\ndoes not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework\nof the Louvre accord,\" the Finance Ministry official said.\n    He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any\nfurther rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only\nhurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt\nproblem.\n    Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their\ninterest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets\nfurther, the monetary officials said.\n    Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined\nto be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further\ndecline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary\nexpectations in the U.S.\n    \"That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre\nagreement is still operative,\" the senior ministry official\nsaid.\n    Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that\nWashington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West\nGermany's increase in short-term interest rates.\n    The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.\nWould be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar\ndecline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,\ntry harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the\naccord, foreign exchange dealers said.\n    But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional\nstatement that \"the Louvre agreement is still operative,\" and\nthis caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the\ndealers said.\n    Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in\nTokyo currency markets.\n    The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised\npressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates\nhigher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,\nor international economic policy coordination.\n    The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,\nFrance, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's\neconomic policies and from time to time apply \"peer pressure\" to\npersuade others to change their policies to a desired course,\nthey noted. \"Without such a basic agreement of multilateral\nsurveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German\npolicy so openly,\" the ministry official said.\n    The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy\nshould thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy\ncoordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse\nof the Louvre agreement, the official said.\n    He also said Japan has not received any specific request\nfrom the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term\nmoney rates have been edging higher.\n    \"This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking\npolicy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate\nrise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,\" he\nadded.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The quality of buffer stock rubber sold\nsince he entered the market in September would be discussed at\nan INRO Council meeting which opened here today, he said.\n    Tokyo traders said on Friday they had little interest in\nbuying rubber from the INRO buffer stock because of possible\npoor quality.\n    Hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the\n\"may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month. INRO's\nfive-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on October\n16. He said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stock\nwas uppermost in consumers' minds.\n    \"We have received good interest for the rubber. I understand\nthe Japanese concern. Many consumers want to try the rubber\nbefore they carry on buying,\" he said.\n    Hofmeister said INRO rubber was stored in 28 different\nlocations in producing and consuming nations, adding all\nwarehouses used were suitable for long-term storage.\n    Selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during the\npast week to 10 days and this could reflect a \"wait and see\nattitude\" by buyers, he said.\n    \"Consumers are holding back from buying additional amounts\nuntil they test out the rubber. If their tests are positiive,\nthey are likely to buy more.\" Hofmeister said he could reduce\nthe offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interest\nbut INRO did not want to depress prices artificially.\n    Hofmeister declined to comment on Japanese trade estimates\nthat he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in Kuala Lumpur\nand New York since September.\n    But he said Japanese traders were in a position to have an\nidea of the quantity he had sold, noting that traders overall\nhad put buffer stock sales at between 25,000 and 35,000 tonnes.\n    The question of sales from the original 360,000 tonne\nbuffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the Council\nmeeting which is scheduled to end on Thursday.\n    The current international rubber pact expires on October\n22.\n    The deadline for the new pact's start is January 1989 and\nHofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber during\nthe interim period.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

          "description": "An income tax surcharge and capital\ngains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of\nthe N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.\n    Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the\nBank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to\nrestore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by\ncurrent government policies.\n    The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn\nwould lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.\nHe added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could\nbe much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.\n    Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a\npercentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was\nprobably unavoidable, Bayliss said.\n    He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct\nvalue-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,\nbut that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.\nImport tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary\nimpact of a currency depreciation.\n    The government had failed to bring inflation down despite\nlower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.\n    New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to\nend-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.\n    The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation\npolicies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and\ninsufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss\nsaid. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt\nand debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.\n    \"The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are\ngoing to take much longer to solve than was originally thought\nis soundly based -- primarily because the government's\nmacro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,\" Bayliss said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

But they said Alliant is trying to bring prices in\nline with discounts it now gives many of its customers.\n    \"(The new FX) is significant to the extent that it\nrepresents Alliant's recognition of the reality of the\nmarketplace,\" said a source who was briefed by Alliant on the\nnew computer. \"The list price is more in line with what they are\nseeing anyway.\"\n    Near-supercomputers, often called mini-supercomputers,\nresemble the massive supercomputers favoured by scientists but\nare much less expensive and a quarter as powerful.\n    Supercomputers cost well over one mln dlrs but\nmini-supercomputers are generally priced between 200,000 dlrs\nand one mln dlrs.\n    Most near-supercomputers use a new computer architecture\ncalled parallel processing, in which a problem is broken up\ninto segments and each segment assigned to a different\nprocessor. General-purpose mainframe computers have just one\nprocessor that works on one segment of a problem at a time,\nmaking them too slow for complex scientific problems.\n    Near-supercomputers have been in existence for only about\nfive years and the two leading manufacturers, Alliant and\nConvex Computer Corp (CNVX), held two of the most successful\ninitial public offerings last year.\n    But Alliant and Convex, a Texas company, are also facing\nsome 15 companies competing for between 200 and 250 mln dlrs in\nsales this year, and the result has been lower prices and\nshrinking profit margins.\n    Heavy discounting, slow acceptance outside the scientific\nmarket, lack of software and too many competitors also have\nmade analysts reassess prospects for near-supercomputers.\n    Jeffrey Canin, computer analyst with Hambrecht and Quist,\nsaid he just added a year to his original growth estimates for\nthe industry. He now expects sales to reach 1.1 billion dlrs in\n1991, instead of 1990.\n    In recent weeks both Alliant and Convex have said their\nthird quarter earnings would be reduced by \"competitive pricing\npressures.\"\n    Alliant said profits for the period will be about five\ncents a share against eight cents last year, although revenues\nfor the period rose to 14.2 mln dlrs from 8.6 mln.\n    Convex said third quarter earnings will be less than the\nsecond quarter's 12 cents a share while revenues will rise\nalmost eight mln dlrs over the 1986 third quarter to between 18\nand 18.5 mln dlrs.\n    Until now, most of the price discounting occurred at the\nbottom of the product line in near-supercomputers, but ETA\nSystem's announcement could start squeezing Convex and Alliant\nfrom the top, analysts said.\n    ETA, a subsidiary of Control Data Corp <CDC>, introduced\ntwo machines that are really full-blown supercomputers similar\nto those sold by Cray Research Inc, the world's biggest\nsupercomputer maker, but at half the price of Cray's cheapest\nmodel. The ETA-10 Model P costs 995,000 dlrs and the Model Q is\n1.2 mln dlrs.\n    ETA officials told a news conference the new machines may\nbe classified as supercomputers but they are aimed directly at\nthe upper end of the product lines from Alliant and Convex.\n    Acceptance of ETA's product could be hampered by lack of\nsoftware, analysts said, noting this is an issue that faces all\nparallel processor makers to some degree.\n    Because parallel processing is a new architecture that has\nyet to be widely used, third party software vendors have been\nslow to write programs for the near-supercomputers.\n    ETA, however, \"offers a low priced entry into supercomputers\nfor some customers,\" one consultant said.\n    Canin cautioned that \"the price pressures will continue for\nsome time\" and estimated that five percentage points have been\nknocked off the gross profit margins of both Convex and Alliant\nthis year by price discounting.\n    Next year, he said, the two companies will face a new set\nof problems as they both introduce their second generation of\nproducts. \"I am always cautious about the first major product\ntransition.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience\nwith some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord\ndue to their fears of increasing inflation.\n    Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary\npressures also slow domestic demand.\n    West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to\nboost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade\ndeficit, Tanaka said.\n    U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still\nmassive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest\nrates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.\n    \"Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations\ncoordinate dollar buying intervention,\" said Soichi Hirabayashi,\ndeputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange\ndepartment.\n    The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally\nconsidered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.\n    \"The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near\nfuture and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations\nfailing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre\naccord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,\"\nHirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as low\nas 135 yen soon.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

          "description": "The Soviet Union's industrial output is\ngrowing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign trade\nhas fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show.\n    Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show\nindustrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of\n1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period.\n    Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986\nperiod as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2\npct.\n    Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion\nroubles. Separate import and export figures were not given.\n    One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction\nof a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last\nyear's calculations of industrial output included all goods,\nirrespective of quality.\n    Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader\nMikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special\ninspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below\nstandard.\n    Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were\nrejected in the nine-month period.\n    The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more\nthan 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000\npeople. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,\nPravda said, without giving comparative figures.\n    The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the\neconomy has been an important part of the modernisation\ncampaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the\nsetting up of small shops on a private basis.\n    Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months\nagainst 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986.\n    But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity\nfigures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in\nthe West, which measures worker output over a given period.\n    Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union\nas of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5\nmln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period\nlast year. Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against\n194 roubles a year ago.\n REUTER\n\u0003",
